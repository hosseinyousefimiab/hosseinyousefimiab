# hossein yousefimiab

Welcome! I’m **Hossein Yousefimiab**—an early-career researcher obsessed with computational mechanics, spectral methods, and data-driven optimization of advanced composite structures.

## 👋 Who am I?

- **Background:** Mechanical Engineer (and proud computational nerd)
- **Current Focus:** Graduate research in spectral and meta-learning methods for structural analysis and design, especially on optimization methods  
- **Core Skills:**
  - Spectral Element Method (SEM) for plates, shells, and stiffened structures
  - Python & MATLAB for scientific computing (with hands-on, production-level code)
  - High-performance codeing (MATLAB / C / Python)
  - Custom Genetic Algorithms for structural optimization (no black-boxes!)
  - Deep learning (PyTorch, meta-learning) for regression & optimization

---

## 🔬 Current & Recent Projects

- **Meta-Learned Bayesian Optimization (MLBO)**  
  Meta-learning with MAML and Transformers for few-shot optimization of composite panels (multi-stiffener, variable stacking sequences)
- **Spectral PINNs & Modal Coefficient Regression**  
  Physics-informed neural networks with Chebyshev expansions, focusing on spectral accuracy and physical interpretability
- **Automated Simulation Pipelines**  
  Generating 500,000+ structural datasets via MATLAB + Python, with full workflow for transfer/meta-learning
- **Curved Panel SEM**  
  Extending classic SEM for curved shells and arbitrary geometry, with periodic boundary conditions and 3D mapping

## 🤝 Let’s Collaborate!

I’m always open to:
- International research projects on advanced simulation, meta-learning, or optimization
- Joint code development for SEM/PINN solvers or ML-for-mechanics
- Academic exchange or co-supervision

> Professors: If you’re interested in my work or potential collaborations, just [send me an email](mailto:Hossein.yousefimiab@sabanciuniv.edu)!

## ⚡ A bit more about me

I’m practical, fast-iterating, and love “debugging” both code and real-world engineering ideas.  
If you need to talk shop about composite structures, spectral codes, or want to optimize something that’s hard—**I’m in.**

*Thanks for stopping by. For code, datasets, or just a good technical chat, check my pinned repos or drop me a message!*
