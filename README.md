## 👋 Who am I?

- **Background:** Mechanical Engineer (and proud computational nerd)
- **Current Focus:** Graduate research in spectral and meta-learning methods for structural analysis and design, especially on optimization methods  
- **Core Skills:**
  - Finite Element Method (FEM) and Spectral Element Method (SEM) for plates, shells, and stiffened structures
  - Python & MATLAB for scientific computing (hands-on, production-level code)
  - High-performance coding (MATLAB / C / Python / Julia)
  - Parallelization and optimization for large-scale simulations
  - Custom Genetic Algorithms for structural optimization (no black-boxes!)
  - Deep learning (transfer learning, meta-learning) for few-shot training & optimization
  - **Shell scripting and automation:** connecting Python, MATLAB, C, and Julia workflows—*everything can be connected!*

## 🔬 Current & Recent Projects

- **Meta-Learned Bayesian Optimization (MLBO):**  
  Meta-learning with MAML and Transformers for few-shot optimization of composite panels (multi-stiffener, variable stacking sequences)
- **Spectral PINNs & Modal Coefficient Regression:**  
  Physics-informed neural networks with Chebyshev expansions, focusing on spectral accuracy and physical interpretability
- **Curved Panel SEM:**  
  Extending classic SEM for curved shells and arbitrary geometry, with periodic boundary conditions and 3D mapping

## 🧰 Technical Stack

- **Languages:** Python, MATLAB, C, Julia (prototyping & HPC)
- **Tools:** HPC clusters (SLURM), VS Code, MobaXterm, advanced shell scripting for automating workflows
- **Parallelization:** Efficient use of multicore and cluster computing for simulation and optimization ( i can make better and faster)

## 🤝 Let’s Collaborate!

I’m always open to:
- International research projects on advanced simulation, meta-learning, or optimization
- Joint code development for SEM/PINN solvers or ML-for-mechanics
- Academic exchange or co-supervision

> Professors: If you’re interested in my work or potential collaborations, just [send me an email](mailto:Hossein.yousefimiab@sabanciuniv.edu)!

## ⚡ A bit more about me

- I thrive on building and breaking things—both in code and in engineering.  
- My style: rapid prototyping, fearless refactoring, and turning complex research ideas into working code (even if it means long nights with MATLAB and Python open side by side).
- I love bridging “old-school” mechanics with new-school ML, and I get a kick out of automating what others say can’t be automated.
- If it can be parallelized, I’ll make it faster; if it can be scripted, I’ll find a way.
- I have strong opinions about code structure, reproducibility, and making sure every result is logged (for future me, mostly).
- My research vibe: blend of theory and practice—no black-boxes, always seeking to understand “why” as much as “how.”
- Ask me about spectral element methods, composite optimization, or which shell command will glue your workflow together.  
- Favorite research break activity: plotting convergence curves or making my workflow one bash script shorter.
- I believe *everything can be connected* (and should be, if you want to save time for the gym or real life).

*Thanks for stopping by. If you want to collaborate, debate spectral codes, or need a clever automation hack, my inbox is open.*
